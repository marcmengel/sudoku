# sudoku
Heuristic based sudoku solver in Python

Currently you input the puzzle by editing the end of the
file, there are several examples there if-ed out and one
if-ed in.

It usually uses heuristics to solve, and occaisonally resorts
to backtracking/guessing when it doesn't have a definite constraint; 
picking the (one of the) most constrained location(s) to backtrack
on.
